# Protobuf Implementations 

This project explores using the protobuf protocol over json for high performance inter-service communication.

* Interface description language for API
* Platform & language neutral for serializing/deserializing structured data optimized for interservice communication
* Provides client libraries automatically for most used BE languages
* Proto types existing that correspond to exiting common types (int, string, boolean, etc). These contain default values.
* OneOf type is similar to interface implementations
* 1-15 used for most used fields
* Must exercise caution for altering field ordering and type setups
*
